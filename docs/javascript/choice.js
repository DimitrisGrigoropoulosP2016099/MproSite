Sinatra was born in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1915, and his music is still noteworthy and enjoyed today, even though he sadly passed in 1998.Sinatra took a liking to music from a young age, and began singing soon after. His uncle gave him a ukulele for his fifteenth birthday, and he started playing at family gatherings. During his time at Demarest High School in Demarest, New Jersey, he arranged bands for school dances.As a teenager in the 1930s, Sinatra began singing professionally, despite not being able to read music. When he was 20, his mom persuaded him to join a local singing group. The group became a success after winning a talent show hosted by Edward Bowes. Their prize was a six-month contract to perform on stage and on the radio across the U.S.Sinatra released his solo debut in March 1946, titled The Voice of Frank Sinatra. He went on to release sixty-one more albums, some of which were live renditions of his hits.Over the span of his career, Sinatra captured the hearts of millions. His jazz-inspired sound has made a mark on the world that no new artist can erase.", "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TnlPtaPxXfc", "1966", "Dean Kay & Kelly Gordon", "Jimmy Bowen", "Frank Sinatra", "That’s Life"],

Marked by the guitar virtuosity of Billy Corgan and lyrics that alternate between snarling fuck-off diatribes and tender introspection, Smashing Pumpkins were a four-piece force to be reckoned with.  Though featuring a variety of different members across a thirty year span, the original lineup included drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, guitarist James Iha and bassist D'arcy Wretzky.

The band rehearsed a lot and took part at most of the local music fest and played many shows in the capital of the country, Chisinau. The first period of the band finished after graduating from the lycee by three members of the band.<br> A little pause was crucial in defying the future music direction of the band influenced by such bands as Dream Theater, Pain of Salvation, Andromeda, Rush and many other progressive monsters. So, the band reopened its activity by the year 2001 in a renewed lineup. The music was more like progressive rock/metal more than a brutal one. <br>In this period the band played many local shows. The band recorded some songs in this period and stopped again from live and rehearsal activity near the year 2006 because of lack of time and perspectives. In 2009 the virtual activity of the band was reopened and the band which consisted of only two members, the Voluta brothers. Actually, the band was Valentin's hobby during the studio years. Eugen joined the band Infected Rain in 2012 and concentrated mostly on playing and working live with the other moldavian metal band.<br> So the band is actually mostly a studio project which involves new musicians and featured singers opened for fun!", "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b3-2pUBtnOI", "2021", "Brooke Dougherty & Seas on the Moon", "Brooke Dougherty & Seas on the Moon", "Brooke Dougherty & Seas on the Moon", "single"],
        ["id6", "Time Machine", "photos/id6.jpg", "Sometimes an album by a new band gets everything right. Such is the case with Painted Shield and their eponymous debut release on Loosegroove Records. Rather than sounding like a tentative identikit of musical styles, it’s a brilliantly conceived, bold and cohesive portrait of its creators – chiefly Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard, singer-songwriter Mason Jennings and drumming star Matt Chamberlain – and a clear-eyed statement of purpose.  Driven by pulse-racing electronic and live drums, bursting with gritty and sometimes psychotic guitars that weave in and out of luxurious keyboard soundscapes, and brimming with glorious melodies that fill the senses and hang on tight, everything about the album – a genre-bending mix of roots rock, electronica and contemporary folk-pop – feels so effortlessly assured.  Gossard sings the praises of his Painted Shield bandmates (“With Matt and Mason, this is what collaboration is supposed to be”), but he also stresses the importance of other friends and artists who contributed to the album, chief among them keyboardist/singer Brittany Davis and mixer John Congleton. “Brittany Davis is a Seattle singer-songwriter and force to be reckoned with. With people like that, it’s easy to say, ‘OK, here’s the song. It’s yours to mess around with.’ That’s where the magic is.” Other artists featured on Painted Shield include Mike McCready, Jeff Ament, Lonnie Marshall, Josh Freese, Om Johari and Jeff Fielder.", "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vTCZuHc96do", "2020", "Mason Jennings & Stone Gossard", "Painted Shield", "Painted Shield", "Painted Shield"],

Take the 2014 debut album from the MARMOZETS – Becca MacIntyre, Sam MacIntyre, Josh MacIntyre, Jack Bottomley and Will Bottomley – a band that’s more than a gang: they’re quite literally family. “THE WEIRD AND WONDERFUL MARMOZETS” perfectly encapsulated the unpredictable yet undeniable music the Bingley band had been creating since their inception. “THE WEIRD AND WONDERFUL MARMOZETS” arrived via Roadrunner in 2014 and was greeted with unprecedented acclaim from a range of international publications. “As fine an articulation of the thrills, spills and general confusion of being young and different in the U.K. as you're likely to hear,” exclaimed Kerrang! before honoring “THE WEIRD AND WONDERFUL MARMOZETS” as the year’s “Best Album” at the 2015 Kerrang! Awards. Q applauded the album as, “a very impressive, ambitious debut,” while Noisey highlighted vocalist Becca MacIntyre as someone who “…could be instrumental in a big change for British rock. 2017 marked the return of the MARMOZETS with their new single, ‘Play,’ which earned the unprecedented accolade of being declared both Radio 1’s Daniel P. Carter’s ‘Rockest Record’ and Annie Mac’s ‘Hottest Record’. NME highlighted ‘Play’ as one of their best new tracks and added, “The Brit alt-rockers return and they’re sounding absolutely massive.", "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oCJIUBf01Z0", "2017", "Larry Hibbitt & Marmozets", "Gil Norton", "Marmozets", "single"]
